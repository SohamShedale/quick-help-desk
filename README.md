Quick Help Desk is a Website to help executives raise an issue for the devices in a cabin which can be viewed by the resolver on his side. The resolver gets to know the device_id, table_no and the issue_type that has been raised by the executive. The page reloads every 2sec and beeps a sound on the resolver side whenever an issue is been raised.
